This is the changelog for FASTX::Reader. Version prior to v 0.1 are preliminary (alpha) release, not to be used in production.
Some APIs *can change* with the release of the first stable release (v 1.0).
Version 0.61 has been available via BioConda

1.10.0 2023-01-13
  * `new()` FASTX::Reader method now supports a named parameter instantiation, e.g. `FASTX::Reader->new(-file => 'file.fastq')`
  * `new()` FASTX::Seq method now supports a named parameter instantiation, e.g. `FASTX::Seq->new(-seq => 'CACCA')`
  * Added `copy()` method to FASTX::Seq
  * Added quality methods to FASTX::Seq:
    * `qualities()` to get an array of scores, `trim_until(int)` and `trim_after(int)`
    * functions like `char2qual()` and `qual2char()` to convert between ASCII and integer scores
    * `$record->offset(new)` to change offset (default is 33)
  * Test updates, minor changes
  

1.9.0 2023-01-12
  * Added `slice(from, len)` method to FASTX::Seq (works as substr)

  * Added `is_fasta()` and `is_fastq()` methods to FASTX::Seq
  * Added `as_fasta()` and `as_fastq()` aliases to FASTX::Seq (for syntax consistency)
